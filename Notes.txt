VSCode Shortcut
VSCode has a built-in shortcut you can use for generating all the boilerplate in one go. 
Please note that this shortcut only works while editing a file with the ‘.html’ extension or 
a text file with the HTML language already selected. To trigger the shortcut, 
delete everything in the index.html file and just enter ! on the first line. 
This will bring up a couple of options. Press the enter key to choose the first one, 
and voila, you should have all the boilerplate populated for you.

But it’s still good to know how to write the boilerplate yourself in case 
you find yourself using a text editor like notepad (heaven forbid) which doesn’t 
have this shortcut. Try not to use the shortcut in your first few HTML projects,
so you can build some muscle memory for writing the boilerplate code.
